Problem 1: Add all the natural numbers below one thousand that are multiples of 3 or 5. 
(Euler1.py)

Potential efficnecy improvements:
1. Ignoring eveything divisble by 2
2. Ignoring numbers below 4 (who cares?)

Notes: 
Can this be condensed to 1 line?

Problem 2: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
